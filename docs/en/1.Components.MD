# Idea

Each object has fields and methods.

The main idea was to realize a system in which the implementation of object methods was not important and to give the possibility to change individual methods of the object in the runtime, in order to provide the variability of using the same code with different implementations of individual elements of the runtime.

Such elements were the User and the Neural Network.

In which five common interfaces that receive the same type of data and that produce the same type of data were allocated.

**User:**
- UII Input interface void (Input) -> str
- UTI Interface Processing translation str -> str

**Artificial Intelligence(AI)**
- ACI Interface Chat str -> str 
- ATI Interface Translation Processing str -> str
- AVI Voice Interface str -> void (print, play)

![](../cont/dialog_entity.png)

The solution was to load methods from our own add-on system, which in turn were written on our own "framework"

![](../cont/core_scheme.png)

Add-ons became collections with modules implementing interfaces (interface modules), and "dialog" objects began to be collected in runtime by config values and found with identical key values by modules in the loaded collection.

That's briefly what's going on in the core.

## Core

The core is a set of utilities and logic that implements the basic functionalanal

## Interfaces 

**Interface** is a component of an object that describes the interaction of the module logic with the rantime.

**Module Interface** module is a logic block embedded in place of the interface that implements processing of incoming data and returns a similar type of data

```py
# An example of a translation interface module.
# Accepts text of type string, returns text of type string

def translate_interface(text:str) -> str:
    return text
```

### Types of interfaces

**User:**
- Input interface void (Input) -> str
- Interface Processing translation str -> str

**Artificial Intelligence**
- Chat str -> str 
- Translation Processing interface str -> str
- Voice interface str -> void (print, play)

**Menu**
- Module Config Manager Interface (config, addon) -> None

## Interface Module Collections 

Collections of interface modules are implemented by a common class with fields containing dictionaries sorted by the interfaces whose modules they contain.

```py
uii user_input_interface() -> str
uti user_translate_interface(text:str) -> str
aci ai_chat_interface(text:str) -> str
ati ai_translate_interface(text:str) -> str
avi ai_voice_interface(text:str) -> None # Print() Play_voice()
stm settings_menus(config:Config, obj:Interface_Collection) -> None
```

## Addons

Addon -  is a collection of interface modules that includes its own module implementation. The addon can be loaded and sorted into a common collection of modules

An addon can initialize module variables and also allow modules to be rebuilt when the configuration changes

```py
# How the structure of the collection of modules of the interface of the intput interface looks like (By analogy, other collections will look the same way)

self.user_input_interface = {
    "Exemple Input" : exemple_user_input_interface_module_func
    "Exemple Microphone input" : exemple_user_input_interface_module_func
}
```

The initialization of an addon is described by a generic class whose fields contain lists of its interface implementations

The initialized addon is passed to the load_addon function in the **`__init__.py`** file

```python
def load_addon():
    #  v Addon class v Constructor call
	return Addon_Simple_Use_Template() # Your Addon Class

```

This function is called for each addon in the addon loader **`gulysh_lib.addon_lib.load_addons`** and ensures that the addons get into the general collection and sorted out

The addon can be built from the template located in `gulysh_lib.addon_lib.AddonTemplate` and adding to `__init__.py` file a function that returns the class of your addon

![](../cont/addon_struct.png)
Addon structure. Your repository may look like this.

**Example:**

```py
from gulysh_lib.addon_lib import AddonTemplate

# Creating an addon class

class Addon_Simple_Use_Template(AddonTemplate):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Initialize the parent class of the framework
        super().__init__()
        self.my_API_CLASS=VipAPI()

    def pre_init(self):
        pass

    # I override the method of initialization of interface modules

    def init_interfaces(self):
        # Define a reference to the module object in the initialization namespace
        self = self

        # Adding interface modules

        # Decorator adding an interface module
        @self.add_Interface("Input Exemple", "user_input_interface")
        # Interface module
        def user_input_interface_exemple() -> str:
            return self.my_API_CLASS.send( input("Write to Neuro: ") )
        ...

# Function of addon initialization
        
def load_addon() -> AddonExemple:
    # Bringing back the already assembled addon class
    return Addon_Simple_Use_Template() # Your Addon Class
```

# Menu
> [!WARNING]  
> TO DO: Generic compositor, not window rendering by the menu module. If you have overridden the `Menu.start` menu method.
It's worth considering, on the seamlessness of the update*

 

SOW Core - also has a framework, so that you can add your own menu.

## How to create menu

To create your own menu, you should place it in the addon class and inherit from the main menu class in the **`gulysh_lib.menu_lib.Menu`**

```py

from gulysh_lib.addon_lib import AddonTemplate
from gulysh_lib.menu_lib import Menu

# Creating an Addon class. How to do it correctly above ^
class Addon_Class(AddonTemplate):
    ...

    class Addon_Menu(Menu):
        ...
```
And add it as a **`stm`** module by adding a function calling the menu using a decorator.

*Transmitted values may change with refactoring*

```py
class Addon_Class(AddonTemplate):
    ...

    def init_interfaces(self):
        self=self 
        @self.add_Interface("Custom_Menu", "stm")
        def start_menu():
            self.Addon_Menu().start()

    class Addon_Menu(Menu):
        ...
```

The worst thing the author of this game came up with is `selector` - An interface to interact with menu items, accepting a collection for the user to select a value and returning the value selected by the user.

Used to call functions within collections, call other menus, used in the **`Settings_Menu`** class, to work with values returned in the config

By default, the menu is called by the start function, which calls the selector and calls the functions in the menu_fields collection.

>[!WARNING]  
> Warning, if you decide to override this method, you may be subject to refactoring conditions described in TO DO*

```py
class Addon_Menu(Menu):
    ...
        
    def start(self):
            while True:
                
                self.clear_console()
                
                i = self.selector("Change menu point: ", self.menu_fields)
                
                if i == None:
                    return
                i()
```

Adding fields to the menu is done by overriding the `init_fields` function

```py
class Addon_Menu(Menu):
    def __init__(self, dbg=False) -> None:
        # Initializing the parent class
        super().__init__(dbg)

    # I start overriding the method
    def init_fields():
        ...
```

To add your item to the menu, you just need to call `self.add_field("SIGNATURE TITLE", SIGNATURE)` passing the title to the menu and the value returned when selected by the selector

`@self.add_fieldFunc("SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT")` a decorator that allows you to add your own functions to the menu (Which can also call up other menus).

```py

def init_fields():
    @self.add_fieldFunc("Заголовок")
    def Значение_Заголовка():
        #Calling another menu inside a function under the decorator
        My_Settings_Menu(self.config, self).start()
```

## Settings menu

To work with configuration files yaml, also created a separate class menu settings `gulysh_lib.menu_lib.Settings_Menu`.  Which accepts the config with which it works and the addon object to reload it

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment, it is possible to handle a config with double nesting and only with it. Keep it in mind when you plan your config.
> If you need to handle any other nesting, you will have to override the `get_conf_path`, `add_settings_point`, `add_settings_write_point` methods

*(The author doesn't know how to try to handle dynamic nesting, everything is nailed down here;-;)*.

**How to add a customization menu**

This is just a modified Menu class. Creating and Adding it will be similar. 

It is inherited from the Menu class. Its initialization and working with it is similar to the Menu class **But it takes your config and addon object to reload**

```py
class Addon_Class(AddonTemplate):
    ...

    def init_interfaces(self):

        # Define the module object in the method scope block 
        self=self 

        # Adding a menu interface module
        @self.add_Interface("Custom_Settings_Menu", "stm")
        # Menu caller module
        def start_menu():
            
            # Calling the Settings Menu
            self.Addon_Menu(self.config, self).start()

    # Our class menu
    class Addon_Menu(Menu):
        def __init__(self, dbg) -> None:
        # Initializing the parent class
        super().__init__(dbg)

    # I start overriding the method
    def init_fields():
        ...
```

**How to work with configs in menus**

To add settings fields, there are two methods `add_settings_point` to work with collections of parameters (Select) and `add_settings_write_point` for manual user input of field value (Enter)

- `add_settings_write_point` accepts: Field name, Object to be updated (more often Addon), Variable parameter in config, Variant collection
- `add_settings_write_point` accepts: Field name, Object updatable, Writable parameter in config

```yml
#Let's imagine a config like this
# yml
api:
    api_key: ""
    voice: "Voice 1"
```

```py
# python 
def init_fields():
        
        def init_fields(self):
            self = self
            # Example of a collection with variants 

            collection = {
                "Voice 1" : "wqrtnmcvxp4q145sdfm",
                "Voice 2" : "asdfqrtasdasdmcvfhp4q497sdfm"
            }

            # Example of a selection field from the above collection
            self.add_settings_point("Character", self.obj, "api.voice", collection)

            # Example of API-key input in the form of an input field
            self.add_settings_write_point("API KEY", self.obj, "api.api_key" )
            
```
